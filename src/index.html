	<div class="tagline"><h3>Learn more about Hansel Perez. I dare you.</h3><p>I was born of my mother and father on the last day of the first month of the last year of the seventies. As a child I had no skills. I drew more energy from the world around me than I contributed. As time advanced, I became more focused and selective with my time. I had a passion for drawing and writing. I developed both skills and today I use them to shape the world to fit my taste. I do not waste time because there is no such thing as time. The only metric I belive in is completed projects.</p>

			<h3>I am peerless in the mastry of my skills because no one else on earth has them, too.</h3>
			<p>I use drawing to animate things. While I was trained in the traditional method, I now use Photoshop to infuse sould into a lifeless arrangement of pixels. I can make words bounce on the page, or I can fly a small plane around the heads of unsuspecting commuters.</p>
